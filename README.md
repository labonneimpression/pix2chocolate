# pix2chocolate
Render a low-relief chocolate from any image. This is especially useful for previewing a chocolate in an e-commerce flow.
For now, the chocolate chip model is a "Petit Ã©colier"-like chocolate biscuit. This might help us save the world.

## Technical stack
- Inkscape is used to save a PNG heightmap from an SVG file.
- Blender 2.79 + Micro-displacement + GPU optimizations (the aim is to provide fast previews to future web or offline users)
- Tiny SH shell script - for Linux systems.

## Usage
Run `sh pix2chocolate.sh` (will use the LaBonneImpression logo).
Or provide an image of any time as first parameter: `sh pix2chocolate.sh smiley.png`.

## Example (Milestone 1)
1. Create a PNG heightmap (eg. greyscale image) by hand
![Image of Logo heightmap](https://github.com/labonneimpression/pix2chocolate/raw/master/LaBonneImpressionLogoHeightmap.png)
1. Run the `pix2chocolate.sh LaBonneImpressionLogoHeightmap.svg` script and observe console output like
```

1. Observe the resulting image named test0001.png

## Milestones
1. Drop heightmap SVG file in directory, run manually Blender rendering, show chocolate render offline
1. Drop any image (logo (vector or raster), face, landscape, object), for logos (or low-color solid backgrounded images only) run auto-crop/center/rotate manually, generate heightmap generation manually, run manually Blender rendering, show chocolate render offline
1. (current) Drop an image, run 1 command only for the last step, show chocolate render offline
1. Same as before, but do a 3d rendering preview of multiple images on one circle path (ie. camera rotation only on the X-Y plan) (see [CloudImage](https://github.com/scaleflex/js-cloudimage-360-view))
1. In a different project:
    1. wrap this with an encrypted REST API,
    1. wrap this REST API with JS web form.

## Installing
Download everything (ie. the [master.zip archive of the main branch](https://github.com/labonneimpression/pix2chocolate/archive/master.zip)).
Install [Blender 2.79 or maybe 2.8](https://www.blender.org/download/previous-versions/).
(Optionally) install imagemagick if you want to pass files instead of use the LaBonneImpression logo.
If you are not using Linux, you might want to alter the SH script first for your OS.
